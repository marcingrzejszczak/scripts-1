{% capture billboard_description %}

Spring Cloud Pipelines is a project containing CD pipelines for your applications.
It contains empty pipelines templates and also its opinionated implementation.
Currently we support the following CI / CD systems out of the box

* Concourse
* Jenkins

## Features

Spring Cloud Pipelines comes with the following features

* opinionated microservice pipeline for Concourse

* opinionated microservice pipeline for Jenkins using Job DSL plugin

* empty template of a pipeline for Jenkins using `Jenkinsfiles`

## Quick Start

<script type="text/javascript">{% include custom.js %}</script>

You can easily start by running the default demo setup to run the whole system locally using
Docker and PCF Dev.

We are providing a demo pipeline that will build and deploy - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook[Github Webhook] application.

All in all there are the following projects taking part in the whole `microservice setup`.

- [Github-Analytics](https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics) - the app that has a REST endpoint and uses messaging. Our business application.
- [Github Webhook](https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook) - project that emits messages that are used by Github Analytics. Our business application.
- [Eureka](https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka) - simple Eureka Server. This is an infrastructure application.
- [Github Analytics Stub Runner Boot](https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot) - Stub Runner Boot server to be used for
tests with Github Analytics. Uses Eureka and Messaging. This is an infrastructure application.

For the detailed information please check out the [docs](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines.html).

### Concourse

* Fork the [Github Webhook](https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook) and [Github-Analytics](https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics) repository
* Start [PCF Dev](https://pivotal.io/platform/pcf-tutorials/getting-started-with-pivotal-cloud-foundry-dev/introduction)
* Clone the `spring-cloud-pipelines` project
* Go to `concourse` folder
* Run `./setup-docker-compose.sh` to setup keys for Concourse
* Run `./start.sh 192.168.99.100` to start Concourse and Artifactory (e.g. for `192.168.99.100`
being external IP of your docker images. If you don't have Docker Machine you can run the `./what_my_ip.sh` script
and pass that value here)
* Run `./deploy_infra.sh` to upload to your Artifactory the infrastructure apps (`eureka` and `stub runner`)
* Run `./login.sh 192.168.99.100` to log in to your Concourse (where `192.168.99.100` is you Docker Machine ip -
if you're using `localhost` you don't have to provide that value)
* Setup your `credentials.yml` basing on the provided `credentials-sample.yml` (point to your forked [Github Webhook](https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook))
* Run `./set-pipeline.sh` to setup pipeline for `github-webhook`
* Unpause and run the pipeline in Concourse!
* Once the pipeline passes you can setup a new pipeline for `github-analytics`

### Jenkins

* Fork the [Github Webhook](https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook) and [Github-Analytics](https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics) repository
* Start [PCF Dev](https://pivotal.io/platform/pcf-tutorials/getting-started-with-pivotal-cloud-foundry-dev/introduction)
* Clone the `spring-cloud-pipelines` project
* Go to `jenkins` folder
* Run `./start.sh yourGithubUser yourGithubPass yourGithubOrg` to start Jenkins and Artifactory (`yourGithubUser` and `yourGithubPass`
are your Github credentials required by the pipeline to tag the forked repo that lays in `yourGithubOrg`)
* Run `./deploy_infra.sh` to upload to your Artifactory the infrastructure apps (`eureka` and `stub runner`)
* Go to Jenkins and click the `jenkins-pipeline-seed` in order to generate the pipeline jobs
* Go to the `github-webhook` pipeline view and click the `play` button to run the pipeline
