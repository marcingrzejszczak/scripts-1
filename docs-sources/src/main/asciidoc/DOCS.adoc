= Cloud Pipelines

This project tries to solve the following problems:

* Creation of a common deployment pipeline.
* Propagation of good testing and deployment practices.
* Reducing the time required to deploy a feature to production.

A common way of running, configuring, and deploying applications lowers support costs
and time needed by new developers to blend in when they change projects.
